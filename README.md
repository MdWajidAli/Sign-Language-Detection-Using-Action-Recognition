# Sign-Language-Detection-Using-Action-Recognition
The project, demploys advanced deep learning techniques to recognize and interpret sign language gestures. By utilizing LSTM networks, this project aims to enhance communication accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities through real-time sign language recognition.

## Below are the steps I've followed to build the project 

## 1. Import and Install Dependencies
#### I've installed various dependencies and libraries of Python as Numpy,Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, TensorFlow.
